        <h2>PRIVACY & SECURITY</h2>
        <p>
            FlashDrop Pro is designed with privacy as a core principle.
            All transfers use direct peer-to-peer connections with end-to-end encryption.
            Files and messages are transmitted directly between connected users
            and never pass through, are uploaded to, or stored on FlashDrop Pro servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a session ends or the browser page is closed,
            all temporary data is immediately destroyed.
            FlashDrop Pro does not retain backups, logs, or historical records of user activity.
